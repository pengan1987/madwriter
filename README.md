This work is a Chinese generative literature script which compose articles with remixing articles from my writing project. The original article will be downloaded from IPFS or Matataki.io as data source and parsed to vocabulary lists then randomly combined with some rules to making new article. Also, this work is a telematic/terminal art originally designed for dumb terminals with Chinese (GBK) capability, I tested it with several Newland NL-3400L networked Chinese terminals.
